      <h2>Where to Get ZLD?</h2>
      <p>
        We don't sell ZLD.
        There are three possible ways to get it:
        1) Fund <a href="https://www.0crat.com/board">any project</a>
        in <a href="http://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a>
        and get an equal amount of ZLD as a reward,
        2) <a href="https://www.0crat.com/join">Join</a>
        any of them as a programmer
        and receive ZLD for the tasks completed, or
        3) <a href="https://github.com/zold-io/zold">Start</a>
        your own Zold node and collect taxes and rewards.
      </p>
      <h2>Is this an ICO?</h2>
      <p>
        No, it's not.
        ZLD is not an investment instrument.
        It is an additional intrinsic motivator for those who are interested
        in joining the software development revolution, which
        <a href="http://www.zerocracy.com">Zerocracy</a> is leading.
      </p>
      <h2>What Is the Roadmap?</h2>
      <p>
        Zold was created and launched by
        <a href="https://www.yegor256.com">Yegor Bugayenko</a> on May 27, 2018.
        The technical cap of the currency is 2.15b ZLD.
        There is a formula that restricts the speed of emission, allowing no greater than
        50% of the total capacity to be issued before May, 2021;
        the remaining 50% can be issued before the end of 2028.
        However, ZLD will be given away
        <a href="https://www.0crat.com/contrib-ledger/CAZPZR9FS">strictly</a>
        according to the rules mentioned above.
      </p>
